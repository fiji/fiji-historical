Today i am going to write my diary for whole week since i have not updated my diary for a week.During this week,i played with JMathLib_Interpreter and became more familiar with the source code.Initially i faced problem regarding startup of JMathLib_Interpreter when i found that there was no package name.So i just addedthe package  name and then there was some problem with commands which was not working well with the current JMathlib interpreter.Gitte helped me by revealing the fact that since it was not a standalone interpreter,it required building a webFunctionsList.dat file.This file had to be created by starting JMathlib and calling createfunctionslist() command in the command line of jmathlib gui.Even when everything has been done and webFunctionsList.dat file is present, its not working properly but i will figure it out soon.

Another thing gitte  mentioned was that JMathlib did not support yet import statements and Javaaddpath() functions which are necessary to be implemented for implementing another .m files in Jmathlib.

I started with implementation of Refresh_JMathlib_Interpreter.java since gitte mentioned that it was  much simple and i had pefect examples already for refresh plugins in the fiji repository.Firstly i had to look at the source code of refresh scripts of other supporting languages.Initially i got a rough idea about the working of refresh scripts but gitte explained the correct implementation about how exactly the new plugins are executed with the help of refresh scripts.I have implemented the Refresh_JMathLib_Interpreter.java with the help of TextUI.java present in the JMathlib source code but actual testing is left still since jmathlib Interpreter is not working well for all the functions even for some basic functions like plot(y,x) its not working fine.Since last day,i am stuck at this step and i am more looking into the source code to find out some minor details whiich i might be missing.
