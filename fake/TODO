- netbeans: use Fake via Ant
- move Ant functions out of the classes, and squash all commits
- Ant script has wrong target for .class rules
- include precompiled/fake.jar in the netbeans and eclipse packages
- make up-to-date check depend on dependencies (rebuild if the dependencies
  needed rebuilding)
- check out Git, or alternatively download via HTTP
- touch the mtime of "unchanged" .jar files
- check variable names again
- handle <target>[jar:<jarfile>]
- add globbing for conditional variables
- verify (and add a test) that changed .config files triggers recompiling jars
- "clean" target: remove .class files, too
- "clean" target: use the command line to determine which rules to clean for
- "clean": clean recursively if a "SubFake" exists.
- check for unknown prerequisites (either a rule exists, or a file)
- call javac in a proper way, so that .class files are not created in src-plugins/
