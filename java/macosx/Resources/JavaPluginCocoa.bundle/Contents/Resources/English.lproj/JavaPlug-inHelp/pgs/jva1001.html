<h1>What is a signed applet?</h1>
</div>
<p>A signed applet is an applet that has a digital signature that confirms it originates from the legitimate server. When the Java Plug-in encounters a signed applet, it checks the certificate to ensure the applet was created and signed by the individual who made the certificate.&nbsp; It also verifies that the contents of the Java applet have not been modified or tampered with.

<h2>The Java plug-in displays several security options:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trust: You trust the author of the applet and want to run the applet.&nbsp;
<p>
<li>Don't Trust: You don't trust the author of the applet, and don't want to run the applet.
<p>
<li>Show Certificate: Let's you examine the attributes of each certificate in the certificate chain.
