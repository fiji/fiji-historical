This is Fiji
============

Fiji will provide an easy way to set up Java+ImageJA+TrakEM2+VIB+a lot of
other plugins that are useful, at least to neuroscientists.

At the moment, the following platforms are supported:

- Windows-x86
- Linux-x86
- Linux-x86_64
- MacOSX-PowerPC

Setup should be as easy as unpacking the (portable) application and starting
the Java wrapper.  The wrapper is a program that starts the Java machine
hands-free, i.e. it sets the correct settings to start up ImageJ with the
plugins directory and heap size set up for you.

In a way, you could say that the "F" in "Fiji" stands for "painless",
"easy", "quick" and "convenient" :-)

Open Source
-----------

We are dedicated to open source.  Not only does open source allow other
developers to port the application to new platforms that the original
authors did not begin to think of, it permits others to use the program
in totally new ways, and enhance it in all imaginable ways.

Therefore, Fiji is licensed under the GNU Public License, version 2 (of
course, this license only applies to Fiji: the build system and the Java
wrapper).  Not version 3, because we think that it is not our job to
educate everybody to be a decent person; that's every person's own job.

In the same vein, Fiji will contain only Open Source software, unless
there are good reasons for a non-open sourced component to be included.

But those would need to be _very_ compelling reasons.

Thanks

Our first and foremost thanks go to Wayne Rasband, who is not only a very
dedicated developer; he also fosters an active and friendly community
around ImageJ.

The rest of our thanks go to everybody who helped this project prosper.

Oh, and Fiji is also an island.  We just wanted to let you know.
