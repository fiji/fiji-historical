A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- Albert said that plugins.config-added plugins are not added alphabetically
- heed Erwin's advice and http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/development.html
- merge VIB's and Fiji's HandleExtraFileTypes.java
- add a plugin finder (a la Google suggest) to the Control Panel, and make
  it wider by default
- add tools.jar to the releases
- cross compile
- check which Reader Plugins do not extend ImagePlus
- extend GenericDialog to provide Help, Advanced button
- GenericDialog.addTooltext()
- add script recorder for the new scripting languages
- add task-oriented tutorials (wiki)
- add tests (test that all plugins are found, test which image types
  they support, add regression tests, if file importers return ImagePlus)
- look into the ImageJUpdater (maybe we need to disable it)
- add current BioFormats.
- maybe make a live CD from detaolb or some such
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
- make absolute path from argv0 in get_fiji_dir().
- in ImageJA: add Experts- and Simplified views to the GenericDialog.
- in ImageJA: is there a way to have a FileField in GenericDialog?
- in ImageJA: add isCanceled() method to SaveDialog.
- in ImageJA: what about a file extension based construct similar to
  HandleExtraFileTypes for save?  This would allow to work on top of custom
  file formats seamlessly.
- reimplement TransformJ (Stephan Preibisch)
