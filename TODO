A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- win: verify that console window stays open when falling back to system Java
- TrakEM2: use CommandListener to override the "File>Save" menu item
- 3D viewer: Escape should activate the hand
- try RecMaxSupressor (and apply it to 3d)
- move Amira I/O into bio-formats already
- make a JDK-less mirror of fiji.git
- headless: should we activate "batch"?
- find a way to set cwd for sed.py in VIB
- fix "fiji -eval 'run("some script");'"
- exclude ij.jar, headless.jar and precompiled/ij.jar from netbeans project
  (otherwise Netbeans will not use the ImageJ it compiled itself)
- netbeans: exclude the classes found in src-plugins/ij/**/*.java from ImageJA/
- test Bilateral Filter
- Segmentation Editor fails
- compile and test Java7 (has nasty bugs)
- find out why jps shows no title for Fiji's process
- Building "fake.jar" on Windows should warn and resort to making
  precompiled/fake.jar directly.  Same goes for the Fiji launcher.
- add script recorder for the new scripting languages
- use the headless.jar trick to compile MacAdapter.source in ImageJA
- check which Reader Plugins do not extend ImagePlus
- extend GenericDialog to provide Help, Advanced button
- GenericDialog.addTooltext()
- add tests (test that all plugins are found, test which image types
  they support, add regression tests, if file importers return ImagePlus)
- maybe make a live CD from knoppix or some such
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
- in ImageJA: add Experts- and Simplified views to the GenericDialog.
- in ImageJA: is there a way to have a FileField in GenericDialog?
- in ImageJA: add isCanceled() method to SaveDialog.
- in ImageJA: what about a file extension based construct similar to
  HandleExtraFileTypes for save?  This would allow to work on top of custom
  file formats seamlessly.
- reimplement TransformJ (Stephan Preibisch)
- look at ITK
- Matlab (socket)
- backup
