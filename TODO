A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- install Java3D on all platforms (gonna be tricky on MacOSX, I guess)
- support MacOSX/Intel (needs someone with an Intel Mac)
- actually add VIB_compat.jar and TrakEM2.jar (hopefully also BioFormats)
- Makefile's "all" target should make the java wrapper, make ImageJA (if
  present), copy ImageJA's ij.jar into the root directory if it exists
  and is newer than the current copy, and make the plugins
- (For the Makefile, it would be nice to find out how to make a target
  depend on a file, but only if that file is present, so that you do not
  have to check out ImageJA, TrakEM2, or VIB.)
- add targets for all platforms which make wrappers, such as a .zip or
  a .dmg file.
- find a way to determine the optimal heap size in the wrapper
- solve LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem.  Maybe by linking with dlopen()?
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
