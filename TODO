A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- look into the ImageJUpdater (maybe we need to disable it)
- use -port0
- support single-platform portable app
- menu structure!
- add current BioFormats.
- add targets for all platforms which make wrappers, such as a .zip or
  a .dmg file
- maybe make a live CD from detaolb or some such
- find a way to determine the optimal heap size in the wrapper (is that
  still necessary?  For example, on instar, it seems that a sensible
  default is chosen by java already)
- solve LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem for jfftw.  Maybe by linking with dlopen()?
  Or is it enough to put jfftw.so into lib/i386/?  In any case, we need to
  compile FFTW natively for this.
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
- make absolute path from argv0 in get_fiji_dir().
- in ImageJA: enable plugin .config files to access any menu. A flag
  to 'add after <existing_default_menu_entry>' would be awesome.
