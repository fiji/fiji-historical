A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- exclude ij.jar, headless.jar and precompiled/ij.jar from netbeans project
  (otherwise Netbeans will not use the ImageJ it compiled itself)
- netbeans: exclude the classes found in src-plugins/ij/**/*.java from ImageJA/
- put ij.Menus from ImageJA's fiji branch into misc/Fiji.jar, so that updating
  ImageJ will still work.
- plugins updater
- test Bilateral Filter
- Segmentation Editor fails
- compile and test Java7 (has nasty bugs)
- find out why jps shows no title for Fiji's process
- Building "fake.jar" on Windows should warn and resort to making
  precompiled/fake.jar directly.  Same goes for the Fiji launcher.
- scripts/commit-submodule.py: add to .gitmodules, too
- add script recorder for the new scripting languages
- add task-oriented tutorials (wiki)
- add current BioFormats.
- use the headless.jar trick to compile MacAdapter.source in ImageJA
- Albert said that plugins.config-added plugins are not added alphabetically
- add a plugin finder (a la Google suggest) to the Control Panel, and make
  it wider by default
- check which Reader Plugins do not extend ImagePlus
- extend GenericDialog to provide Help, Advanced button
- GenericDialog.addTooltext()
- add tests (test that all plugins are found, test which image types
  they support, add regression tests, if file importers return ImagePlus)
- maybe make a live CD from detaolb or some such
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
- in ImageJA: add Experts- and Simplified views to the GenericDialog.
- in ImageJA: is there a way to have a FileField in GenericDialog?
- in ImageJA: add isCanceled() method to SaveDialog.
- in ImageJA: what about a file extension based construct similar to
  HandleExtraFileTypes for save?  This would allow to work on top of custom
  file formats seamlessly.
- reimplement TransformJ (Stephan Preibisch)
