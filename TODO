A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- extend GenericDialog to provide Help, Advanced button
- GenericDialog.addTooltext()
- add script recorder for the new scripting languages
- add task-oriented tutorials (wiki)
- add tests (test that all plugins are found, test which image types
  they support, add regression tests, if file importers return ImagePlus)
- extend Fiji launcher so that it can fall back to non-bundled Java
- look into the ImageJUpdater (maybe we need to disable it)
- support single-platform portable app
- menu structure!
- add current BioFormats.
- add targets for all platforms which make wrappers, such as a .zip or
  a .dmg file
- maybe make a live CD from detaolb or some such
- solve LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem for jfftw.  Maybe by linking with dlopen()?
  Or is it enough to put jfftw.so into lib/i386/?  In any case, we need to
  compile FFTW natively for this.
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
- make absolute path from argv0 in get_fiji_dir().
- in ImageJA: enable plugin .config files to access any menu. A flag
  to 'add after <existing_default_menu_entry>' would be awesome.
- in ImageJA: add Experts- and Simplified views to the GenericDialog.
- in ImageJA: is there a way to have a FileField in GenericDialog?
- in ImageJA: add isCanceled() method to SaveDialog.
- in ImageJA: what about a file extension based construct similar to
  HandleExtraFileTypes for save?  This would allow to work on top of custom
  file formats seamlessly.
- reimplement TransformJ (Stephan Preibisch)
