A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- install Java3D on all platforms (gonna be tricky on MacOSX, I guess)
- support MacOSX/Intel (needs someone with an Intel Mac)
- start framework for plugins (see below)
- actually add VIB_compat.jar and TrakEM2.jar (hopefully also BioFormats)
- add a root Makefile
- Makefile's "all" target should make the java wrapper, make ImageJA (if
  present), copy ImageJA's ij.jar into the root directory if it exists
  and is newer than the current copy, and make the plugins
- (For the Makefile, it would be nice to find out how to make a target
  depend on a file, but only if that file is present, so that you do not
  have to check out ImageJA, TrakEM2, or VIB.)
- add targets for all platforms which make wrappers, such as a .zip or
  a .dmg file.
- clean up (the java/ subdirectory is not needed, I guess, the wrapper should
  be moved to the root directory, the ImageJ/ directory should be dissolved)
- find a way to determine the optimal heap size in the wrapper

Plugin framework
----------------

- Make a directory plugins/
- Make a directory staged-plugins/
- Add files of the form staged-plugins/VIB_compat.jar.config
- Add a Makefile which picks up all staged-plugins/*.jar,
	- checks if they are newer than the plugins/*.jar equivalent
	- if yes, adds the config as plugins.config, and copies it
- Plugins will only be checked in in plugins/, the config files only in
  staged-plugins/, to prevent jars from being checked in in staged-plugins/,
  they will be ignored there
