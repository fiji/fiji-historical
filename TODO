A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- install Java3D on all platforms (is not as easy as unpacking
  java3d-1.5.1-macosx.zip on MacOSX -- it crashes -- so probably need
  to recompile)
- support MacOSX/Intel (needs someone with an Intel Mac)
- add BioFormats.
- add targets for all platforms which make wrappers, such as a .zip or
  a .dmg file.
- find a way to determine the optimal heap size in the wrapper (is that
  still necessary?  For example, on instar, it seems that a sensible
  default is chosen by java already).
- solve LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem for jfftw.  Maybe by linking with dlopen()?
  Or is it enough to put jfftw.so into lib/i386/?
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
