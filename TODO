A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- find out why jps shows no title for Fiji's process
- teach Fake to check for precompiled/fake.jar, and use it if it is newer than
  the current fake.jar file.  Then undo the Fake.sh cuteness in this regard.
  Likewise, building "fake.jar" on Windows should warn and resort to making
  precompiled/fake.jar directly.  Same goes for the Fiji launcher.
- scripts/commit-submodule.py: add to .gitmodules, too
- add script recorder for the new scripting languages
- add task-oriented tutorials (wiki)
- add current BioFormats.
- use the headless.jar trick to compile MacAdapter.source in ImageJA
- Albert said that plugins.config-added plugins are not added alphabetically
- add a plugin finder (a la Google suggest) to the Control Panel, and make
  it wider by default
- check which Reader Plugins do not extend ImagePlus
- extend GenericDialog to provide Help, Advanced button
- GenericDialog.addTooltext()
- add tests (test that all plugins are found, test which image types
  they support, add regression tests, if file importers return ImagePlus)
- look into the ImageJUpdater (maybe we need to disable it)
- maybe make a live CD from detaolb or some such
- maybe change the path of IJ_Prefs.txt also on other platforms than Win32?
- in ImageJA: add Experts- and Simplified views to the GenericDialog.
- in ImageJA: is there a way to have a FileField in GenericDialog?
- in ImageJA: add isCanceled() method to SaveDialog.
- in ImageJA: what about a file extension based construct similar to
  HandleExtraFileTypes for save?  This would allow to work on top of custom
  file formats seamlessly.
- reimplement TransformJ (Stephan Preibisch)
