At the moment, list of different ways users can add, remove or update their Fiji Plugins

MANUAL WAY

To add a plugin:
-Download a JAR or CLASS ImageJ plugin file (Either 3rd party or from Fiji download page is fine).
-Place it into fiji/plugins folder.
-Restart Fiji for changes to menu structure to take effect.

Implications:
-For "JAR" plugins, plugins.config determines the location of the menu items, and thus should exist
-You have to be careful that the plugin's physical filenames do not clash when you copy it over. Otherwise you have to either overwrite it, or change to a new filename.
-Dependencies may pose a problem if you add a new plugin which depends on another plugin which you have not added in

To remove a plugin:
-Close Fiji application.
-Move the relevant plugin file (JAR or CLASS) away from the fiji/plugins folder.
-Start Fiji to see that it is removed.

Implications:
-Going strictly by manual way, it may be difficult to keep track of what plugins are there.
-Dependencies may pose a problem if a plugin is removed which another relies on it

To update a plugin:
-Close Fiji application.
-Replace the existing, corresponding JAR or CLASS plugin file with the newer one on fiji/plugins folder.
-Start Fiji to see that it has been updated.

Implications:
For "JAR" plugins, keep note of plugins.config - Make sure location specified do not conflict with other existing plugins' menu item locations.
"JAR" plugins.config is deleted.

Fiji Updater plugin:

Fetches updates from the server using information in current.txt.

-Calculates md5 sums of existing plugins.
-Checks it with md5 sums and dates that server has listed in current.txt
-Same file but different md5 sums and later date of file at server => Update
-Information displayed at the interface
-User selects the desired updates
-To update, download and save at "update" directory
-Restart Fiji, where contents of update directory will overwrite corresponding files
--> Note actual updating is responsibility of the Fiji launcher, not updater



Fiji's plugins.config file, format should be as follows:

MENU_CATEGORY>SUB_MENU, MENU_ITEM_NAME (in double quotes), function name (plugin's Java constructor, or some script function)

Note: SUB_MENU may not be needed at all if you want menu item name to appear within the menu itself.

i.e: MENU_CATEGORY, MENU_ITEM_NAME, function name

e.g in the form of Image5D:
Plugins>Image5D, "Virtual Image5D Opener", Virtual_Image5D_Opener("")
