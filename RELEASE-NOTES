We are glad to announce the first release of Fiji, codenamed Dresden.

Fiji is Just ImageJ, batteries included.

Fiji is an ImageJ distribution that bundles a collection of plugins, jar libraries and scripting languages in a consistent framework.

Fiji includes Java JDK and java3d, and is available for Windows, MacOSX and Linux.

Fiji aims at convenience in plugin use and reuse, and includes an updater to keep up to date with bug fixes and improvements.

Fiji targets image registration, stitching, segmentation, feature extraction and 3D visualization, among others.
For examples see http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de

Fiji brings together several ImageJ-based projects including ImageJA, VIB, bUnwarpJ, TrakEM2, and others, kindly developed and distributed under open source licenses.

For developers, Fiji provides its own build system, Fake (Fiji+Make), and is distributed under version control with git. The main Fiji executable is native, cross-platform, and provides numerous features for easy plugin compilation and interaction.

 Ignacio Arganda, Albert Cardona, Erwin Frise, Greg Jefferis, Verena Kaynig, Mark Longair, Stephan Preibisch, Stephan Saalfeld, Johannes Schindelin, Benjamin Schmid, Cornelius Sicker, Jean-Yves Tinevez, Pavel Tomancak.
