The jfftw package is a Java interface to FFTW, a highly optimized FFT algorithm library.



NOTES

jfftw-1.4 was created for FFTW-2.1.3.

The C header files were generated with the `javah' tool distributed with the Sun Java SDK.
They might be platform specific, but probably they aren't.

Documentation is included in the Java source files and can be extracted with the `javadoc'
tool distributed with the Sun Java SDK. (A prebuild version is also included in the `doc'
directory.)



Building jfftw under Windows

It was tested with Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5 and
Sun's J2SDK-1.4.0.
Step 1.
	Set your environment variables:

	set JAVA_HOME=c:\devel\j2sdk1.4.0
	set FFTW_INCLUDE=c:\devel\java\devel\speech\fftw-2.1.3\fftw
	set FFTW_LIB=c:\devel\java\devel\speech\fftw-2.1.3\fftw
	set RFFTW_INCLUDE=c:\devel\java\devel\speech\fftw-2.1.3\rfftw
	set RFFTW_LIB=c:\devel\java\devel\speech\fftw-2.1.3\rfftw

	(These are my paths, you should set your own. JAVA_HOME should point to where
	you can find jni.h as %JAVA_HOME%\include\jni.h, FFTW_INCLUDE is the path to
	fftw.h, FFTW_LIB is the path to fftw.lib, RFFTW_INCLUDE is the path to rfftw.h
	and RFFTW_LIB is the path to rfftw.lib.)

Step 2.
	Execute makefile.win:

	nmake /f makefile.win



COPYING

FFTW was created by MIT, jfftw was created by Daniel Darabos (darabos@mit.bme.hu).
