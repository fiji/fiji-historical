Notes for Fiji developers
=========================

Fiji is organised into the following components:

- The Fiji superproject

- The following submodules

	- ImageJA

	- TrakEM2

	- VIB

The idea is to follow the projects in the submodules relatively closely,
and wrap them, together with Java, and make an easy installable package.

Building Fiji (including the submodules) should be as easy as calling
"make" in the project root directory.

Of course, this assumes that you have a Bash, make and g++ handy.  On
Linux/Unix and MacOSX, this is no problem.

For Windows, the easiest way is probably to use the msysGit package
(http://msysgit.googlecode.com/).  The standalone installer should
be enough.

Note that you'll probably need git (at least 1.5.3) in any case, to
handle the submodules, 3rd-party plugins, and to contribute back.

The menu structure for the plugins
----------------------------------

TODO

Installing 3rd party plugins
----------------------------

Please try to avoid closed-source plugins.

Just move the .jar into staged-plugins/, and create/adjust the corresponding
.config file (also in staged-plugins/).  Then type "make" and it will be
added/updated and committed.

Longer version:

The .config file should look something like this:

	File, "Show Prime Numbers", Primes_("")

where "File" is the menu you want to add the item to -- at the moment, the
only valid choices are "Plugins", "Plugins><submenu>", "File>Import",
"File>Save", "Analyze>Tools", "Help>About" and "Edit>Options".

Next comes the title of the menu item, and lastly the class name of the
plugin with a parameter that will be passed to the run() method of that
class.

In other words, the .config file will become the plugins.config of the
.jar file.

Please make sure that your .config file is designed such that the
menus fit in snuggly with the common Fiji menu structure.

Then just "make", and the plugin will be automatically installed and
committed (this needs "git" installed, though).
