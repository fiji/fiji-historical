Debian Packages for Fiji
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This branch has some very basic support for building Debian packages
of ImageJA, the Fiji launcher and some of the Fiji plugins, which
should be installable on Ubuntu and Debian.

To get the test versions, add the following lines to your
/etc/apt/sources.list:

  deb http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/ ./
  deb-src http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/ ./

... and do:

  apt-get install fiji

(The fiji package just has dependencies on:

   imageja
   fiji-plugins (contains VIB as well)
   trakem2

... and a symlink so you get ImageJA when running fiji.  There's also
an imageja-doc apackage with the ImageJA API javadoc.)

You can run the package with:

  $ fiji

Alternatively, to fetch and build the source archive:

  apt-get build-dep fiji 
    (This might encourage you to install a sun java JDK when you
    already have one - a known bug - just manually install the other
    dependencies that you really need from the list it suggests.)

  apt-get source --compile

Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

 - The copyright file (and author information generally) needs more work.

      http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs.html#s-copyrightfile

   Should have per-package copyright information, rather than just
   including LICENSES in each one

 - Package descriptions need to be written properly (and the ImageJA
   man page added to.)

 - Build dependencies seem to want sun-java5-jdk even though I have
   sun-java6-jdk installed?

 - Lots of stuff from the master branch isn't in these source
   packages.  This is mostly because I very quickly had to pick only
   the things we could currently compile completely from source (using
   build-dependencies in Debian where possible) - for example, this
   means that there's no JRuby, since only 1.0 is in Debian so far:

     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=449607

   ... and no Clojure:

     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=454566

 - jtk submodule not committed yet (oops)

 - Remove JRuby 1.0 from classpath

 - Java3D still has to be installed separately

Changes in these versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the aims of Fiji can't currently be realised in these packages
since they depend on distributing non-free components (e.g. Java3D -
unless it's going to be in openjdk?)

ImageJA is essentially dependent on Sun's Java (it doesn't work well
enough on free versions of Java to be included in main) so these
packages couldn't go into main for the moment anyway.  Hopefully
openjdk will get in there soon, however, so this can too.

The source tree can generally be made much simpler since this branch
will only target Linux systems.  For example, this means that we can
use a simple shell script to launch ImageJA instead of using the
launcher.  (The launcher wouldn't quite work as intended anyway, since
the packaged jars aren't in a self-contained folder - however, it'll
take a little effort to keep this script identical in behaviour with
the binary launcher, e.g. adding the headless option at the moment.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to try building the packages from the git tree, rather
than with apt-get source --compile, you can try the following:

  rm ../fiji_0.9.0.orig.tar.gz
  make clean
  make orig
  make debs

... and look in packages/
